 `Browse` or type the location of the folder where you would like to install the Exercism CLI.  Click the `Next` button when ready to proceed.  
 
 You may use the `Browse` button to locate the folder in which to install the CLI.

Click the `Ok` button to accept your folder selection.

## Download and Install  
 ![Client Download Form](img/install.png)  
 At this point the installer will proceed to download the latest version of the CLI for your OS architecture from the GitHub Repo for the Exercism CLI.  The downloaded ZIP file will automatically be unzipped into the folder you previously selected.

 Click the `Next` button once the process completes successfully.  
 
## Configure CLI  
 ![Configure api token](img/configure.png)  
 The final step is to enter the Exercism api token which allows you to fetch, keep track of exercises, submit solutions etc.  This token is assigned to you when you initially sign up with Exercism.  Use the `I don't have or don't know my token` link to retrieve your token as needed.  
 Once you have input your token click the `Configure` button.  This will invoke the Exercism CLI which will be passed the token you just provided.  The output of the CLI will appear in the box at the bottom of the screen (I have blocked out my information).
